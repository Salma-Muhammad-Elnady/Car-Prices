# **Car Prices Regression Project**
#### The project aims to predict the price of a car based on a set of features such as insurance risk rating, car company, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheel type, engine location, dimensions (wheelbase, length, width, height), weight, engine type, cylinder count, engine size, fuel system, engine specifications (bore ratio, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak RPM), and mileage (city and highway). The goal could be to analyze or predict the car's price based on these attributes.
