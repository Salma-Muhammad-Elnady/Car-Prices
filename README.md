# **Car Prices Regression Project**
#### The project aims to predict the price of a car based on a set of features such as insurance risk rating, car company, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheel type, engine location, dimensions (wheelbase, length, width, height), weight, engine type, cylinder count, engine size, fuel system, engine specifications (bore ratio, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak RPM), and mileage (city and highway).
## Project Aims 
___________________________________________________
### 1. Data Import:
+ Download the car price dataset from Kaggle.
+ Import and clean the data by handling any missing or incorrect values. 

### 2. Data Analysis:
* Explore data and analyze different features.
* Create visualizations to highlight the relationships between different features and car prices.

### 3. Model Building:
* Try different algorithms like: LinearRegression, polynomial regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random forest, Decision tree.   
* Train the model using the data and evaluate its performance using metrics like: R2-Score, MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE. 
### 4. Model Improvement:
* Improve the model using techniques like cross-validation and feature engineering.
* Compare different models and select the one that provides the best accuracy.
